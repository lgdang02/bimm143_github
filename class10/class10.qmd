## The PDB Database

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB for short). It is the second oldest database (after Genbank).

What is currently in the PDB? We can access current composition stats [here](https://www.rcsb.org/stats)

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
head(stats)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", stats$X.ray))
```

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray

#Substitute comma for nothing
y <- gsub(",", "", x)

# convert to numeric
sum(as.numeric( y ))
```

Turn this snippet into a function so I can use it any time I have this comma problem (i.e. the other columns of this `stats` table).

```{r}
comma.sum <- function(x) {
  #Substitute comma for nothing
  y <- gsub(",", "", x)
  
  # convert to numeric and sum
  return( sum(as.numeric( y )) )
}
```

```{r}
xray.sum <- comma.sum(stats$X.ray)
em.sum <- comma.sum(stats$EM)
total.sum <- comma.sum(stats$Total)
```

```{r}
xray.sum/total.sum*100
```

```{r}
em.sum/total.sum*100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", stats$Total[1]))/total.sum
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

SKIPPED

## 2. Visualizing with Mol-star

Explore the HIV-1 protease structure with PDB code: `1HSG`
Mol-star homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/.

## 3. Using the bio3d package in R

The Bio3D package is focused in structural bioinformatics analysis and allows us to read and analyze PDB (and related) data.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

We can see atom with `pdb$atom`:

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
head( pdbseq(pdb) )
```

## Visualization in R

We can make quick 3D viz with the `view.pdb()` function:

```{r}
library(bio3dview)
library(NGLVieweR)

#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor="pink", colorScheme="sse")
```

```{r}
sel <- atom.select(pdb, resno=25)

#view.pdb(pdb, cols = c("green", "orange"),
#         highlight = sel,
#         highlight.style="spacefill") |>
#  setRock()
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can finish off today with a bioinformatics prediction of the functional motions of a protein.

We will run a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA)

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
#view.nma(m)
```

We can write out a trajectory of the predicted dynamics and view this in Mol-star 

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="nma.pdb")
```
