## Background

This mini-project explores unsupervised learning techniques applied to a
dataset of human breast cancer cell measurements. The goal is to use
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a pre-processing step before
applying clustering algorithms to identify patterns in the data without
prior knowledge of diagnosis. The data, originating from the Wisconsin
Breast Cancer Diagnostic Data Set, contains measurements of cell nuclei
features from fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies. The analysis
involves exploratory data analysis, performing and interpreting PCA, and
then applying and evaluating both hierarchical clustering and k-means
clustering methods, including a comparison of clustering results with
known diagnoses and a discussion of sensitivity and specificity.
Finally, the project demonstrates how to predict the principal
components for new data points.

## Data import

Our data come from the U. of Wisconsin Medical Center

``` r
wisc.df <- read.csv("WisconsinCancer.csv", row.names = 1)
```

> Q1. How many patients/samples are in this dataset?

``` r
nrow(wisc.df)
```

    [1] 569

> Q2. How many of the observations have a malignant diagnosis?

``` r
table(wisc.df$diagnosis)
```


      B   M 
    357 212 

``` r
sum(wisc.df$diagnosis == "M")
```

    [1] 212

> Q3. How many variables/features in the data are suffixed with \_mean?

``` r
colnames(wisc.df)
```

``` r
length( grep("mean", colnames(wisc.df), value=T) )
```

There is a diagnosis column that is the clinician consensus that I want
to exclude from any further analysis. We will come back later and
compare our results to this diagnosis.

``` r
diagnosis <- as.factor(wisc.df$diagnosis)
head(diagnosis)
```

    [1] M M M M M M
    Levels: B M

Now we can remove it from the `wisc.df`

``` r
wisc.data <- wisc.df[,-1]
```

## Clustering

Let’s try a `hclust()`

``` r
hc <- hclust( dist(wisc.data) )
plot(hc)
```

![](class08_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

We can extract clusters from this rather poor dendogram/tree with the
`cutree()`

``` r
grps <- cutree(hc, k=2)
```

How many individuals in each cluster?

``` r
table(grps)
```

    grps
      1   2 
    549  20 

``` r
table(diagnosis)
```

    diagnosis
      B   M 
    357 212 

We can generate a cross-table that compares our cluster `grps` vectors
with our `diagnosis` vector values

``` r
table(diagnosis, grps)
```

             grps
    diagnosis   1   2
            B 357   0
            M 192  20

## Principal Component Analysis

### The importance data scaling

The main function for PCA in base R is `prcomp()` it has a default input
parameter of `scale=FALSE`.

``` r
#prcomp()
head(mtcars)
```

                       mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
    Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
    Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
    Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1
    Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1
    Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2
    Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1

We could do a PCA of this data as is and it could be mis-leading…

``` r
pc <- prcomp(mtcars)
biplot(pc)
```

![](class08_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

Let’s look at the mean values of each column and their standard
deviation.

``` r
colMeans(mtcars)
```

           mpg        cyl       disp         hp       drat         wt       qsec 
     20.090625   6.187500 230.721875 146.687500   3.596563   3.217250  17.848750 
            vs         am       gear       carb 
      0.437500   0.406250   3.687500   2.812500 

``` r
apply(mtcars, 2, sd)
```

            mpg         cyl        disp          hp        drat          wt 
      6.0269481   1.7859216 123.9386938  68.5628685   0.5346787   0.9784574 
           qsec          vs          am        gear        carb 
      1.7869432   0.5040161   0.4989909   0.7378041   1.6152000 

We can “scale” this data before PCA to get a much bettter representation
and analysis of all the columns.

``` r
mtscale <- scale(mtcars)
```

``` r
round(colMeans(mtscale))
```

     mpg  cyl disp   hp drat   wt qsec   vs   am gear carb 
       0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0 

``` r
apply(mtscale, 2, sd)
```

     mpg  cyl disp   hp drat   wt qsec   vs   am gear carb 
       1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1 

``` r
pc.scale <- prcomp(mtscale)
```

We can look at the two main results figures from PCA - the “PC plot”
(a.k.a. score plot, ordination plot, or PC1 vs PC2 plot). The “loadings
plot” how the original variables contribute to the new PCs.

A loadings plot of the unscaled PCA results

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(pc$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, rownames(pc$rotation) ) +
  geom_col()
```

![](class08_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)

Loadings plot of the scaled data.

``` r
ggplot(pc.scale$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, rownames(pc$rotation) ) +
  geom_col()
```

![](class08_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)

PC plot of scaled PCA results

``` r
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(pc.scale$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pc.scale$x)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text()
```

![](class08_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png)

> **Key point**: In general, we will set `scale=TRUE` when we do PCA.
> This is not the default but probably should be…

We can check the SD and mean of the different columns in `wisc.data` to
see if we need to scale - hint we do!

### PCA of wisc.data

``` r
wisc.pr <- prcomp(wisc.data, scale=TRUE)
```

To see how well PCA is doing here in terms of capturing the variance (or
spread) in the data we can use the `summary()` function.

``` r
summary(wisc.pr)
```

Let’s make the main PC1 vs PC2

``` r
ggplot(wisc.pr$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, col=diagnosis) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("PC1 (44.3%)") +
  ylab("PC2 (19%)")
```

![](class08_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png)

> Q4. From your results, what proportion of the original variance is
> captured by the first principal components (PC1)?

44.3% is captured by the first principal components (PC1).

> Q5. How many principal components (PCs) are required to describe at
> least 70% of the original variance in the data?

3 PCs are required to describe at least 70% of the original variance in
the data.

> Q6. How many principal components (PCs) are required to describe at
> least 90% of the original variance in the data?

7 PCs are required to describe at least 90% of the original variance in
the data.

> Q7. What stands out to you about this plot? Is it easy or difficult to
> understand? Why?

``` r
biplot(wisc.pr)
```

![](class08_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png)

This plot is very difficult to understand because there are too many
points on the same graph.

``` r
plot(wisc.pr$x, col =diagnosis, 
     xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")
```

![](class08_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png)

> Q8. Repeat the same for principal components 1 and 3. What do you
> notice about these plots?

``` r
plot(wisc.pr$x[, c(1, 3)], col = (diagnosis), 
     xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC3")
```

![](class08_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png)

These plots show very similar separation of the two groups, red cluster
group (malignant) to the left or negative direction while black cluster
group (benign) to the right or positive direction.

## 5. Combining methods

We can take our PCA results and use them as a basis set for other
analysis such as clustering.

### Clustering on PCA results

``` r
wisc.pr.hclust <- hclust( dist(wisc.pr$x[,1:2]), method="ward.D2" )
plot(wisc.pr.hclust)
```

![](class08_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png)

> Q11. Using the plot() and abline() functions, what is the height at
> which the clustering model has 4 clusters?

At height 20, clustering model has 4 clusters.

We can “cut” this tree to yield our clusters (groups):

``` r
pc.grps <- cutree(wisc.pr.hclust, k=2)
table(pc.grps)
```

    pc.grps
      1   2 
    195 374 

How do my cluster grps compare to the expert diagnosis

``` r
table(diagnosis, pc.grps)
```

             pc.grps
    diagnosis   1   2
            B  18 339
            M 177  35

> Q15. How well does the newly created model with four clusters separate
> out the two diagnoses?

The newly created model with four clusters separate out the two
diagnoses are not good.

> Q16. How well do the k-means and hierarchical clustering models you
> created in previous sections (i.e. before PCA) do in terms of

They did really badly. We do much better after PCA - the new PCA
variables (what we call a basis set) give us much better separation of M
and B.

## 7. Prediction

We can use our PCA model for the analysis of new “unseen” sata. In this
case from U.Mich.

``` r
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/new-samples-CSV"
new <- read.csv(url)
npc <- predict(wisc.pr, newdata=new)
npc
```

PCA shows a nice separation in either positive and negative scores for
the 2 groups. Red cluster is malignant while black cluster is benign.
New patients (red spots) that deviate away most from the clusters should
we prioritize for follow up because they are in malignant group and have
the most variation from the rest of other patients.
